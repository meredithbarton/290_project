          My son, Tristan, is my muse. He and my husband (and myself, of course) are the
          people I cook for, and it is from them that many of my ideas take form.

        The cuisiner I am today began many years ago when <br>I began dabbling in the kitchen.
        While I truly developed as a cook once I started my family, I've loved
        experimenting with flavors and challenging my culinary skills since I was
        in my late teens. I love having company over and cooking for them. Furthermore,
        some of my favorite memeories with my mother and sisters take place, cooking
        together.

        It wasn't until I began cooking for my little one that I decided to start a garden.

        While the garden, first and foremost, serves as a space to call my own, it
        also provides ingredients that I know I can trust, and never have to feel
        question feeding to Tristan. I don't have to give as much thought to
        things like "how important is it <em>really</em> to buy organic?" But, anywway,
        likeI said, the garden is primarily a space for me. I have had so much
        bringing my vision to life, learning about the lifecycle of all kinds of
        plants, and, more than anything, making it my own.

        I began this blog to prove something to myself, and to others. While I'm
        no longer a stay-at-home mom full time (staying true to myself, I work in
        a greenhouse), it can be difficult to be a stay-at-home mom. There's this
        notion people have about stay-at-home moms, that we don't do anything, or
        perhaps that all we do is care for our children. I want the world to know
        that I'm more than Tristan's mom. Yes, I am <em>first and foremost</em>
        his mother, but there's more to stay-at-home moms than meets the eye.
        We create, we grow, and, heck, I do woodworking! How's that for breaking
        the mom stereotype?</p>
