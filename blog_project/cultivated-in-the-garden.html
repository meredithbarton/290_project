          <p>Okay, yes, obviously I own the garden. It's in my backyard and no one
            can say otherwise. But I wanted to show some of the details I put into
            the space to express myself and make it more fun.
            <br>
            <br>
            What's associated with gardens more than anything? GNOMES. Well, maybe
            there are things that are associated with gardens more, but it's what I
            think of. It's so silly, but I absolutely love how it turned out.
            I've always loved the aesthetic of all things whimsical,
            so this was clearly the direction I would head. But, if you make a garden,
            it goes without saying that you don't have to use gnomes! I'm only bringing
            this up as a way to inspire you, my lovely reader, to make the garden
            <em>yours</em>. Don't be afraid to decorate how you like it! I was afraid
            my gnome village would look tacky, but I think it looks perfect! And,
            you know what, even if it did look tacky, <em>that would be okay.</em>
            Reader, what I'm trying to say is that you should do you. And have fun,
            pay no mind to what others think. It is <em>your</em> garden, do what
            makes you happy. </p>

          <p>I cannot believe how much the garden is thriving! I feel increbily
            proud! I've harvested the first products, and am <em>absolutely</em>
            going to be cooking with them tonight (and tomorrow, and the next day).
            I love to spend time out here with Tristan, relaxing and enjoying the
            outdoors, so it's easy to forget that the garden actually serves a purpose,
            and a darn delicious one too. (Did I say I harvested for the first time?
            Because I've definitely been sneaking strawberries for days)</p>

          <p>It's been hard work, but Cole and I finished building the perimeter
            of my garden and I got to work planting. Can I just say> I <em>love</em>
            how it turned out. And, while it looks great now, just wait until it's
            overflowing with greenery!
            <br>
            <br>
            I started most of these plantsfrom seed indoors, so they would be
            strong, healthy, and ready to be left to the whims of the outdoors.
            If you want to start your own garden, this step is <em>very</em> important.
            Sure, my perimeter is nice, but that's not what makes a garden. The garden
            comes from the life living within the walls. Dear reader, I hope you, too,
            can have a garden, and want to emphasize that the health of the plants should
            come before how nice the garden looks, despite how much I'm gushing over
            swell mine is looking.</p>

            <p> I've been growing some potted plants lately, so I decided to
                do something big! I've fallen head over heals with this "growing
                stuff" idea, so Cole and I decided I could see where this takes me.
                We have laid down the framework for a full garden! I have an image
                in my head that I'm determined to make a reality.<br><br>
                I really want a place to call my own. I <em>love</em> staying home
                to take care of Tristan, but I don't want to stop developing as an
                individual, either. This garden will allow me to explore what I'm
                capable of, throwing myself into a project unlike anything I've
                ever done before.
