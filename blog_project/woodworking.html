        <p>My stepmom, Air, had a birthday this week! She's a lovely human whom I
          love dearly, and, as luck would have it, she loves plants almost as much as
          I do. She prefers her plants in pots rather than a garden, so I made her this
          bed as a small garden/bit pot, or, if she prefers, just a table to keep all
          her potted plants in, lol! It has two levels to it, and a number of hooks
          from which she can hang <em>more</em> plants, or hang tools, whatever floats
          her boat.</p>

        <p>I think this is the best thing I've done, in my life, ever. Let me
        start by saying I <em>love</em> Lord of the Rings, and have since I was
        a teenager. Now that I have Tristan, who is roughly the size of a small
        hobbit, runnind around, this project just made sense! It was so, so fun
        to make. Now Tristan has a place to play while I work on all my projects
        outside!</p>
