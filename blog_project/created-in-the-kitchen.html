        <p>I tried my hand at making a quiche! The crust was definitely
        the most challening part. I don't have much experience with pie crust,
        but I know it's a little tricky to get it at the right consistency. My crust
        mostly stayed together, so we'll call that a win!
        <br><br>
        The fillings include ham, bacon, shallots, and a blend of cheddar and
        asiago cheese.</p>

        <p>I cannot explain how much I love pho. My first exposure to this
        lovely dish was from a Vietnamese woman I was close to for many years.
        She would let it cook for <em>hours</em>, letting all of the flavors
        melt together. As luck would have it, my step mom, Air, is a woman from Thailand,
        who makes the best pho I have ever had. Air was so kind as to teach me
        the ways of pho, introducing me to a world of soup that I could never imagine.
        I have some experience with making thai food, being as close to Air as I am,
        but this was something else entirely!</p>

        <p>I had a lovely breakfast today! It's not anything fancy (are croissants
          fancy?), but it was just so darn nice, I had to tell someone about it.
          In the croissant is egg, ham, and swiss, plus bacon on the side, and a
          hot cup of fresh coffee, all enjoyed outside on a perfect morning.</p>
